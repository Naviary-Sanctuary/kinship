# AI Contribution Policy

This project allows AI-assisted work with strict human accountability.

## Requirements

1. AI usage is allowed, but each PR must disclose the tool(s) used and scope of use.
2. PR descriptions must be written by a human, and the author must be able to explain all changed code and design decisions during review.
3. Functional changes must include tests.
4. Submitting large raw AI-generated output without human curation/refinement is not allowed.
5. Repeated low-quality contributions may receive progressive moderation actions.

## PR disclosure format

- Tools used: `<tool names>`
- Scope of use: `<what AI helped with>`
- Human verification: `<what you reviewed/validated personally>`

## Review enforcement

- Maintainers may request revisions or reject PRs that do not comply with this policy.
- Repeated violations may lead to stricter contribution limits.
